    <h1>Welcome to My Canvas Site!</h1>
    <p>
        This site is to showcase my HTML5 Canvas skills! 
    </p>
    <p>
        I began learning HTML5 Canvas so that I could draw graphs on my 
        <a href="https://calculator-sadia765.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html">Calculator Site</a>,
        depicting the solution for the inputted equations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Along the way, I began playing with drawing lines, squares, and rectangles on Canvas. 
        If you like a drawing you build on this site, feel free to save it as a screensaver!
